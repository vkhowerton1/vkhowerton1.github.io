            <p>Taken when I attended a luau in Honolulu, Hawaii after graduating high school</p>
            <p class="large-text">About me:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Personal Background:</strong> I was adopted from Russia when I was 1 years old and then raised in the Raleigh area. I have a younger sister and two step-brothers; one younger and one older.</li>
                <li><strong>Professional Background:</strong> I am currently a sophomore; I graduated high school in 2023 and then committed to UNC Charlotte as an international business major. I quickly realized that business was not what I wanted to do in my future, I then switched to Computer Science a few weeks before I started Freshman year. I am very happy with my decision, I could not imagine myself doing anything else. I am working on landing an internship, as of now though, I am working at a kickboxing studio in Southend part-time.</li>
                <li><strong>Academic Background:</strong> I am not well-established within this subject, though in middle school I took a CompTIA class which covered HTML. I enjoy being creative so I am looking forward to furthering my programming/web design skills.</li>
                <li><strong>Primary Computer Platform:</strong> Windows 11 Laptop</li>
                <li><strong>Courses that I am taking:</strong></li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>ITIS 3135: Web-based Application Design and Development -</strong> Required for major/concentration</li>
                    <li><strong>ITSC 2175: Logic and Algorithms -</strong> Required for my major</li>
                    <li><strong>MATH 1242: Calculus II -</strong> Required for my major</li>
                    <li><strong>CTCM 2530: Critical Thinking -</strong> A general education course that I am required to take</li>
                </ul>
                <li><strong>Fun Fact About Me:</strong> My all time favorite color is pink. I think that it is a cheerful color that expresses my personality perfectly.</li>
                <li>I would describe myself as extroverted; I love talking to people and creating connections. Do not hesitate to reach out!</li>
            </ul>
