            <h3>What is HTML?</h3>
            <p>Before you dive into Web Development, it is important to understand what HTML is:</p>
            <p>HTML is the standard language used to create and structure content on the web. It provides the basic framework for web pages by using a system of elements and tags that define headings, paragraphs, images, links, and other components.</p>
            <p>HTML works alongside CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for styling and JavaScript for interactivity, forming the foundation of modern web development. As a markup language rather than a programming language, HTML structures content rather than executing logic. Its flexibility and accessibility make it an essential tool for anyone looking to build websites, from simple static pages to complex web applications.</p>

            <h3>History of HTML</h3>
            <p>The first public mention of HTML was made by Tim Berners-Lee on October 12, 1991; used to structure and share documents on the World Wide Web. Early versions were simple, but by HTML 4.01 (1999), support for scripting and styling had improved.</p>
            <p>In the 2000s, XHTML was introduced but proved too strict, leading to HTML5 (2014), which brought multimedia support, APIs, and better mobile compatibility. Today, HTML5 remains the foundation of modern web development.</p>
