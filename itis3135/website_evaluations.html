        <h2>Website Evaluations</h2>
        <section>
            <h3><a href="https://www.apple.com/">Apple</a></h3>
            <p>This website showcases and sells products designed by the company Apple. It provides users with information about their latest devices, designs, and services.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> Apple effectively uses contrast with a clean white or dark background, allowing product images and text to stand out. The use of bold typography and high-quality images ensures key elements capture the user’s attention without overwhelming the page. The color scheme is consistent, reinforcing Apple's premium brand identity.</li>
                <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> The website maintains strong repetition in design, ensuring a cohesive user experience. Fonts, colors, and spacing remain consistent across all pages. The navigation bar appears at the top of every page with uniform styling, and product pages follow a structured layout, making it easy for users to browse and compare items.</li>
                <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> Apple’s website follows a strict alignment structure. Content is neatly arranged, with clear margins and spacing. Text, images, and buttons align seamlessly, creating a visually balanced experience. The website also adapts well to different screen sizes, maintaining proper alignment on mobile and desktop devices.</li>
                <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> Apple organizes its content logically, grouping related products and information together. Each section flows smoothly, leading users naturally from one category to another. Product descriptions, images, and pricing are clearly positioned to provide a seamless browsing experience.</li>

            <h3><a href="https://arngren.net/">Arngren.</a></h3>
            <p>This Norwegian website founded in 2002 by Arngren Electronics is primarily used to sell quirky gadgets and appliances. The website showcases a mass collection of different items like vehicles and electronics.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> Arngren uses a multitude of colors against a white background. While this may catch the user’s eye, it is overly distracting and makes the website look cluttered and disorganized. Additionally, different shapes are used to separate products, but they vary in size, and not all products have a designated box, further contributing to the chaotic layout.</li>
                <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> There is little to no repetition on the Arngren website. Navigation links are scattered throughout the product listings, each in a different color, which can confuse users. Furthermore, the navigation bar on the side displays a variety of colors, with some links bolded and others not, lacking consistency.</li>
                <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> The Arngren website lacks proper alignment. Navigation links follow different layouts, and the page does not maintain consistent borders, making it appear messy and "overflowing." The left side of the website is pushed to the edge, leaving a large blank space on the right. Additionally, at the bottom of the page, there is a holiday-themed section featuring the website’s logo and address, which seems out of place.</li>
                <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> While Arngren does separate some products, they are not organized into clear categories. Instead, all listed items are scattered across the page, making the website overwhelming and difficult to navigate.</li>
